            <li>Final project for Sound Design 1 class at Illinois State University.</li>
            <li>Project was to create a narrative or story using sound effects.</li>
            <li>The narrative I created was of a village having a normal day and then a dragon attacked.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>One of the projects I did for Sound Design 1 class at Illinois State University.</li>
            <li>Project was to take audio of only dialogue and underscore it ourselves with music in a couple different ways.</li>
            <li>For this the dialogue used was Gilbert Goddfrey reading the Tragedy of Darth Plageus the wise from Star Wars Episode III.</li>
            <li>The first underscore was using more suspenseful or ominous music to try to give it some of the same vibes as the scene in the movie.</li>
            <li>The second underscore was using more light hearted and silly sounding music because it is being read by Gilbert Goddfrey and it is hard to take him seriously.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>One of the projects I did for Sound Design 1 class at Illinois State University.</li>
            <li>Project was to take a song that was about five minutes or longer in length and try to make it around two minutes long and still make sense musically.</li>
            <li>The song I used was more of a techno song that I found on Epidemic Sound that was originally 5:1o long and I got it down to 1:59 long.</li>
